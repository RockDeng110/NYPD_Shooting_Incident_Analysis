### Conclusion
This report analyzed the NYPD Shooting Incident Data to explore trends in shooting incidents across various boroughs in New York City over time. The primary objective was to identify whether there are discernible trends in the number of shootings across boroughs and determine if certain boroughs are more prone to shooting incidents.

The analysis revealed that the boroughs of Brooklyn and the Bronx consistently experienced higher numbers of shootings compared to Manhattan, Queens, and Staten Island. Additionally, the number of incidents showed an overall decline after a peak in the early 2000s, which may reflect changes in policing strategies, community programs, or socio-economic factors. It also increase sharply from 2019 to 2020, which might caused by the Covid.  

### Future Work
This analysis is limited by the scope of the available dataset, which focuses solely on recorded shooting incidents. Future analyses should consider integrating socio-economic data, police activity records, and crime reporting patterns to offer a more comprehensive understanding of the factors driving these incidents.
